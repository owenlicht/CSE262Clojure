## Instructions

1. Recreate the functionality of the Rust code in Clojure.
2. As you are writing code you should commit changes along the way. *i.e.* don't just submit all your code in one big commit when you're all done. Commit your progress as you work. You should have at least one commit per question. **You will lose points if you do not follow this procedure.**
3. When you've committed all of your work, there's nothing left to do to submit the assignment.

## Assignment

This assignment asks you to familiarize yourself with the syntax and semantics of the Clojure programming language. There are 12 problems in total located in the `src` directory.

Each question presents Rust code at the top (commented out) that you are to translate into equivalent Clojure code. Wherever possible, you should keep the spirit of the original Rust code, but Clojure is a different language after all, so your Clojure solution may go about things a different way. The result of each problem is a single value. The value produced by your code will be tested against the expected value using the `is` function in `core_test.clj`. A correct program will pass this test. A program that produces an incorrect result will fail.

Each commit will kick off an autograding run.
